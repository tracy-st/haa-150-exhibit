This should work for individual items,\n * 2-up paged view and continuous (scrolls).\n *\n * The options are listed below (from IIIF docs)\n *\n * - `unordered` - Valid on Collections, Manifests and Ranges. The Canvases included in resources that have this behavior\n *    have no inherent order, and user interfaces should avoid implying an order to the user. Disjoint with individuals,\n *    continuous, and paged.\n *\n * - `individuals` - Valid on Collections, Manifests, and Ranges. For Collections that have this behavior, each of the\n *    included Manifests are distinct objects in the given order. For Manifests and Ranges, the included Canvases are\n *    distinct views, and should not be presented in a page-turning interface. This is the default layout behavior if\n *    not specified. Disjoint with unordered, continuous, and paged.\n *\n * - `continuous`  Valid on Collections, Manifests and Ranges, which include Canvases that have at least height and\n *    width dimensions. Canvases included in resources that have this behavior are partial views and an appropriate\n *    rendering might display all of the Canvases virtually stitched together, such as a long scroll split into\n *    sections. This behavior has no implication for audio resources. The viewingDirection of the Manifest will\n *    determine the appropriate arrangement of the Canvases. Disjoint with unordered, individuals and paged.\n *\n * - `paged`  Valid on Collections, Manifests and Ranges, which include Canvases that have at least height and width\n *    dimensions. Canvases included in resources that have this behavior represent views that should be presented in\n *    a page-turning interface if one is available. The first canvas is a single view (the first recto) and thus the\n *    second canvas likely represents the back of the object in the first canvas. If this is not the case, see the\n *    behavior value non-paged. Disjoint with unordered, individuals, continuous, facing-pages and non-paged.\n *\n */\nexport declare function getVisibleCanvasesFromCanvasId(vault: CompatVault | undefined, manifestOrRange: ManifestNormalized | RangeNormalized, canvasId: string | null, preventPaged?: boolean): Reference<'Canvas'>[];\nexport declare function getManifestSequence(vault: CompatVault | undefined, manifestOrRange: ManifestNormalized | RangeNormalized, { disablePaging, skipNonPaged }?: {\n    disablePaging?: boolean;\n    skipNonPaged?: boolean;\n}): [Reference<'Canvas'>[], number[][]];\n"],"mappings":";;;;;iBAGwBI,oBAAAA,SAA6BD;oDACCF,qBAAqBC;IADnDE,IAAAA,EAAAA,QAAAA;IAAoB,EAAA,EAAA,MAAA;KAASD;qBACCF,EAAAA,CAAAA,eAAAA,EAIXA,kBAJWA,GAIUC,eAJVD,EAAAA,QAAAA,EAAAA;IAAqBC,aAAAA,CAAAA,EAAAA,OAAAA;IAIhCD,YAAAA,CAAAA,EAAAA,OAAAA;KAAqBC,GAAAA,CAAAA;;IAuCxCG,EAAAA,EAAAA,MAAAA;EAA8B,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,MAAA,EAAA,EAAA,CAAA;;;;;;AACtD;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;iBADwBA,8BAAAA,QAAsCF,0CAA0CF,qBAAqBC,mEAAmEF;iBACxKM,mBAAAA,QAA2BH,0CAA0CF,qBAAqBC;;;;;;KAG7GF"}
